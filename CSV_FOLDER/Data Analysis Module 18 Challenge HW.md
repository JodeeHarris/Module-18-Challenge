Data Analysis Module 18 Challenge Homework

The following data was sourced from the "New York Citi Bike" program (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data). The following data vizualizations are constructed and presented using applications such as Juypter Notebook, Tableau, and Visual Studio Code.

Juypter Notbook was used to clean, format and merge 2017 data and 2022 data of Citi Bike trips in New York. We will be using a random sample of 1000 from the formulated data.

Tableau was used to construct the following dashboards and graphs.

Dashboard "Increased Participation" has three visualizations presented for the data sample of 2017 to 2022. This dashboard is to display the increased user participation trend over the years of 2017 to 2022.

1. "User Increase" is a line graph used to demonstrate the increase of participation between "casual" and "member" user types from 2017 to 2022. When providing by quarter format, the highest user rate was in the third quarter.  

2. "Miles 2017/2022" is a side by side circle graph displaying the average miles rode per quater. The graph indicates an increase of between "casual" and "member" user types miles average from 2017 to 2022.This aligns with the user increase from the first graph. 

3. "Start Avg. 2017/2022 Map" is side by side maps of 2017 and 2022 data. The color coordinated maps display the total average miles rode from a specified station location. It provides the avgerage time traveled per second associated with that station by year. The data presented shows a significant increase in the areas the bikes were used from 2017 to 2022, which supports an increase in user participation.

Dashboard "Time Flux" is the second dashboard used to investigate outliers, data that doesn't fall within normal expected data parameters, via the average travel time per seconds and see how user type data has changed.

1. "Time Travel Year/Month" are continous linear graphs displaying different methodolgies to analyze the time users data spent riding per year and quarter. The graphs follow through an expected direction of growth over the year. By quarter, the graphs follow in varieting directions of increase and decrease. Reviweing the data we start to see more outliers.

2. "Time Travel Year/Month; Avg./Var." graph is used to focus on the yearly and quarterly average and the variance, a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. When we shift to user type, the average decreases with "casual" users from 2017 to 2022 and a slight increase with "member" per year. The variance per year increases at a rate more drastically for "casual" than "member". The second quarter has the highest average and highest variance rate for "casual" users. Both quarterly variance and average for "member" users drop in number then rise in the third quarter. Both quarterly variance and average for "casual" and "member" users hit the lowest data point in the fourth quarter.

3. "Outlier Casual/Member" is a box plot graph used to fit the data within a calculated, ranged parameter and dispaly data that is inconsistent with grouped data. In 2017, there is at least one outlier within every quarter with "member" users. In 2022, there is at least one outlier in every quarter for "casual" users. The most outliers, align with our large variance in data in the second quarter of 2022 data. 

Conclusions:

Both types, "casual" and "member", increased significantly from 2017 to 2022. The average time the bikes were used increased from 2017 to 2022. The peak user count and most time spent on the bikes was in the third quarter during the fall season. User increase translates to more areas of New York having stations avaialble to start at and end. The lowest user count and least amount of time spent on the bikes is the fourth quater during Winter.
